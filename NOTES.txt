*** John Maxwell
We've been using ZWiki as our general purpose web platform for five years
now; its brilliant blend of simplicity and malleability means we've been
able to extend it in a whole bunch of directions: reference library,
blogging platform, discussion forum, classroom support, writing
environment, project tracker, and all-around web content management
tool. We have redesigned our ZWiki-based site from top-to-bottom four
times in five years, and I remain convinced that ZWiki is the most
flexible and capable tool around. - John Maxwell, Canadian Centre for
Studies in Publishing, SFU. http://thinkubator.ccsp.sfu.ca/AboutThinkubator
*** Sascha Welter
One of my cool experiences with Zwiki: I created a site for my father and
I almost never have support questions from him - he's just updating that
site all on his own. He'll be 65 now - not stone old, but still no web hip
youngster any more.
*** Allen Schmidt Sr.
We have been using Zwiki for over 3 years now as a sort of internal
knowledgebase for our group. It has worked out really well and we all like
using it. The issue tracking features are great and it has really helped
keep our small group informed about changes to our site and if offers an
easy way to find out info quickly when we need it.

Thanks for a great project!
