Clarify the role of filesystem and wiki docs
============================================

Filesystem
----------
faster for one developer wielding a text editor
or several devs who are good with darcs
revision controlled - secure, trackable
can work offline
can get out of sync, uncommited changes here and there
can be auto-generated - epydoc, test output, author stats etc.
can be published (but not edited directly) online
less visible and less pretty for readers
better than wiki for large single documents

current uses:

CHANGES - release notes, also published at zwiki.org/ReleaseNotes
CONTRIBUTORS - official contributor list
GPL, LICENSE - license and copyright status
REPOPOLICY - copyright and other developer policies for this repo
README_tests - developer test documentation
README - basic product info
TODO - project plans & todos
other READMEs - basic info for each directory
plugins/latexwiki/LICENSE.txt,NOTES.txt,README.txt - latexwiki-specific copyright info, dev notes, admin/user notes
plugins/mathaction/INSTALL.txt,LICENSE.txt,Notes,README.txt,UPGRADE - needs consolidation like the above
TESTRESULTS - unit test output updated hourly, published at zwiki.org/TestResults
MYNOTES/ - simon's notes & snippets, not published
misc/ - public notes & snippets, published but not committed

Wiki
----
slower to view and slower to edit
more accessible and more editable for a wide audience
one master copy used by everyone - simple
no special tools needed
email integration - notification and mailin
good for indexing and searching many documents (local and google search)
formatting aids - table of contents, headings, tables
more effort to protect and maintain; more vulnerable to decay
more expensive to host - every page takes memory & speed
more public - indexed quickly, for ever
can organize a large number of documents in a hierarchy

current uses:
 
zwiki.org
plone.demo.zwiki.org
free zwikis


Thoughts
--------
filesystem for developers, wiki for users, admins & general public
use text files anywhere for fast developer notes
no special docs directory, just upper-case, no suffix
publish all filesystem docs online, within wiki or in the style of rdoc
restructured text and moving docs between FS and wiki encouraged
wiki needs to be fast
