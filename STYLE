Zwiki coding style and practices
================================

This is both to explain current practices and to collect guidelines that help us.

Documentation
=============

Most Zwiki documentation is kept in the http://zwiki.org wiki.  
Developer-specific docs are under http://zwiki.org/DeveloperNotes.

Developer documentation may increasingly move to files within the
codebase, however.  These typically use restructured text markup, like
this file.  To browse these filesystem docs online, use
http://zwiki.org/repos/ZWiki or the darcsweb interface.
(See also: FILESYSTEM_VS_WIKI_DOCS)

We have the following kinds of in-code documentation:

- ALLCAPS documentation files in any directory, like this README

- File docstrings

- Class docstrings

- Method/function docstrings

- Comments

  - comments are sometimes used instead of the docstrings above. This may
    or may not be appropriate, I don't know.

  - a section heading within a file, class or method.

  - a short explanatory comment appended to a line of code. 

  The Zwiki code has a lot of chatty comments. Nowadays we should try to
  minimise their use eg by using intention-revealing names.

- Names

  Names of directories, files, classes, methods, variables are where
  documentation meets code. They are perhaps our most powerful tool. :)

  Use clarifying and intention-revealing names wherever possible to
  minimise the need for other documentation.

  Choosing good names for small chunks of code helps us to build up our
  own mini-language (DSL) for Zwiki-building, which helps us to say more
  with less code.


Concise, not over-verbose, non-redundant docs are good. To help us write
better docs, we could try to follow this length guideline when possible:

 ================= =================================================
 doc files         any length
 file docstrings   one paragraph
 class docstrings  one paragraph
 method docstrings one sentence, plus one per argument, or as needed
 comments          one sentence, phrase or word, on one line
 ================= =================================================
