# experimental package for non-core plugin modules
#
# A Zwiki plugin is a module providing a mixin class that extends
# ZWikiPage, thereby adding extra features to all wiki pages.  Mixins
# which used to be in the main ZWiki package are gradually being moved
# here. Like page types, it should be possible for zwiki plugins to be
# provided by other products also.
