Skin templates for the standard (non-CMF) skin.

Warning - filterissuesdtml, issuetrackerdtml, recentchangesdtml,
searchwikidtml, and useroptionsdtml are generated files, don't edit them.
Edit the master copies in ../../content/dtml and "make dtml" instead.

Why are we still using DTML in here ? Forms often originate as DTML
embedded in wiki pages and it's sometimes easier to evolve them that way.
Sometimes we hide the dtml behind a page template for consistency.

See also UI.py.
