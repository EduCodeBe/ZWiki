Skin templates for the standard zope (non-CMF) skin. Also two ZMI forms.

See also UI.py.

The wiki-named dtml files like RecentChanges.dtml are based on the
evolving dtml wiki pages on zwiki.org. They are included by the
similarly named page templates, eg recentpages.pt (both standard and
plone versions). They can also be installed as pages via /setupDtmlPages.
