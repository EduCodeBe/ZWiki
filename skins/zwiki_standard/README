Skin templates for the standard zope (non-CMF) skin. Also two ZMI forms.

The wiki-named dtml files like RecentChanges.dtml are based on the
evolving dtml wiki pages on zwiki.org. They are included by the
similarly named page templates (eg recentpages.pt), and can also be
installed as editable pages via /setupDtmlPages.
