Templates, scripts, styleshees, images for Zwiki's standard skin. These
define a single flexible skin that works in both ordinary and CMF/Plone
wikis. See also Views.py.

Also some ZMI forms. See Wiki.py.

The wiki-named dtml files like RecentChanges.dtml are snapshots of the
evolving dynamic wiki pages of the same name at zwiki.org. They are used
as helpers by the similarly named page templates (eg recentpages.pt), or
can be installed as editable wiki pages via /setupDtmlPages.
